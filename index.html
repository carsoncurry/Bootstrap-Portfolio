                        <p>Welcome! You've landed on the portfolio page for Carson Curry, a writer, designer and coder currently navigating the wide world of full stack web design. This is a basic portfolio page created for the KU Coding Bootcamp, of which I am a student. Over the course of the next six months I will be populating this and other pages within the portfolio with projects I have worked on in and outside of the classroom as well as information for contacting me. Consider this your portal to my experience to-date in the world of coding in front and back-end scenarios!</p>
                        <p>I was born and raised in the Kansas City area (both Missouri and Kansas sides) and developed a great passion early on for movies and television, literature, comics (Spider-Man and X-Men all the way), music of nearly all genres (though as a child of the 90s I would be remiss to not mention a preference for some classic hip-hop), video games and sports. As a Kansas City native I've experienced the ups and downs of rooting for the Chiefs and Royals over the years. Here's hoping the Chiefs can catch up to their baseball counterparts sometime in my life!</p>
                        <p>I attended the Unviersity of Kansas between 2008 and 2012, where I graduated with a B.A. in English with an emphasis in creative writing. I utilize my creative writing skills gained in academic, personal and professional life in all of my work. It is my hope that once I have completed my coding bootcamp certification I will be able to apply my passions towards a professional career in the web content and design field.</p>
